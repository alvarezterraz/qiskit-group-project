    "The initial stage involves the creation of an image dataset consisting of circles and crosses. This dataset will comprise a total of 60 images, subdivided into 40 training images (20 circles and 20 crosses) and 20 testing images (10 circles and 10 crosses). To construct this dataset, we developed the `grid_maker.py` software, which facilitates the manual generation of freehand-drawn images on an 8x8 pixel grid. Subsequently, these images are automatically converted into binary vectors (`symbols.csv`), enabling their processing by the neural network.\n"
